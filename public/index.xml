    <description> A compound type is a type that is defined in terms of another type. C++ has several compound types, two of which‚Äîreferences and pointers A reference defines an alternative name for an object.</description>

    <guid>https://costineesti.github.io/about-me/projects/inertial-odom</guid>
    <description>Inertial Odometry is great because it does not care of the environment variables. I used a BNO055 which is an ‚Äúabsolute orientation‚Äù sensor made by Bosch.</description>

    <title>Gaussian Distribution</title>
    <link>https://costineesti.github.io/about-me/projects/Gaussian-distribution</link>
    <guid>https://costineesti.github.io/about-me/projects/Gaussian-distribution</guid>
    <description>A Gaussian or normal distribution always has a bell-shaped curve and is determined by two parameters: the mean \mu and the standard deviation \sigma. The graph associated with this phenomenon is symmetric with its center at the mean, and its shape is determined by the standard deviation.</description>
