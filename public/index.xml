    <title>Gaussian Distribution</title>
    <link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/projects/Gaussian-distribution</link>
    <guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/projects/Gaussian-distribution</guid>
    <description>A Gaussian or normal distribution always has a bell-shaped curve and is determined by two parameters: the mean \mu and the standard deviation \sigma. The graph associated with this phenomenon is symmetric with its center at the mean, and its shape is determined by the standard deviation.</description>
