title: Hello Hello, I'm Costin ðŸ˜Ž

I'm a Software Engineer who graduated from Technical University of Cluj-Napoca (2020-2024). I enjoy challenging myself constantly and I want to dive deep into Machine Learning and AI this year. 
My expertise currently lies in:
* Control Engineering (MATLAB/SIMULINK),
* I'm somewhat of an intermediate when it comes to robotics (definitely working to improve).

I will upload my personal [[projects]] and accomplishments through the years using **Obsidian**.

You can find me @:

>[!NOTE] Some emphasis on my projects

>These notes are primarily written with the goal of creating a vault where I can always find my most important [[projects]]. Therefore, they are filled with **MY** information and if you find something that's off; please contact me and I will change it right away.
