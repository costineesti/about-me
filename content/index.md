I enjoy challenging myself constantly and I want to dive deep into Machine Learning and AI this year.</p> <p>My expertise currently lies in:</p> <ul> <li><a href="obsidian://open?vault=YourVaultName&file=Control%20Engineering">Control Engineering</a> (MATLAB/SIMULINK),</li> <li>I'm somewhat of an intermediate when it comes to <a href="obsidian://open?vault=YourVaultName&file=robotics">robotics</a> (definitely working to improve).</li> </ul> </div> </div>

I will upload my personal [[projects]] and accomplishments through the years using **Obsidian**.

### What I've worked on in the past

* I've been an intern at Bosch for 2 years in a Model-Based team. I have successfully automated the regression test using [[Python]] and MATLAB and now I'm working with SIMULINK mathematical models (we're basically simulating cars).
* I was a serious student in Uni (top 10) and I've really dedicated much time to learn the concepts that they were teaching me.
* My [[Bachelors|bachelors]] degree is my biggest project yet; having implemented a Kalman Filter in order to achieve sensor fusion between a camera and a IMU in order to get the odometry from an autonomous car.

### What I'm currently working on
