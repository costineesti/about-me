    <p>I'm a Software Engineer who graduated from Technical University of Cluj-Napoca (2020-2024). I enjoy challenging myself constantly and I want to dive deep into Machine Learning and AI this year.</p>
    <p>My expertise currently lies in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/projects/Control Engineering">Control Engineering</a> (MATLAB/SIMULINK),</li>
      <li>I'm somewhat of an intermediate when it comes to <a href="/projects/robotics">robotics</a> (definitely working to improve).</li>

I will upload my personal [[projects]] and accomplishments through the years using **Obsidian**.

>[!NOTE] Some emphasis on my projects

>These notes are primarily written with the goal of creating a vault where I can always find my most important [[projects]]. Therefore, they are filled with **MY** information and if you find something that's off; please contact me and I will change it right away.

### What I've worked on in the past

* I've been an intern at Bosch for 2 years in a Model-Based team. I have successfully automated the regression test using [[Python]] and MATLAB and now I'm working with SIMULINK mathematical models (we're basically simulating cars).
* I was a serious student in Uni (top 10) and I've really dedicated much time to learn the concepts that they were teaching me.
* My [[Bachelors|bachelors]] degree is my biggest project yet; having implemented a Kalman Filter in order to achieve sensor fusion between a camera and a IMU in order to get the odometry from an autonomous car.

### What I'm currently working on

>[!hint] ...
> - Improving this site by uploading my knowledge and making sure I fill it with every note I have,
> - thinking of buying a web camera and implementing visual SLAM on it in order to give orientation of a human for indoor applications,
> - Learning C,
> - Improving my C++ experience,
> - Learning ML,
> - Learning AI.
