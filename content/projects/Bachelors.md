 In 2024 I finished my Bachelor's studies at Technical University of Cluj-Napoca. My diploma project was intitulated [[Visual-Inertial Odometry based on lane-detection of an autonomous vehicle with constant speed]].

### Motivation
* I chose this project because of [Steven Gong](https://stevengong.co/) and his experience at F1Tenth; an autonomous racing contest for 1:10 RC Cars. 
* Another inspiration for this project was also [SPOT](https://bostondynamics.com/products/spot/) by Boston Dynamics. The main attraction was the Real-Time SLAM algorithm it could execute.

### Introduction

>[!NOTE] What is sensor fusion and odometry?
>	[[Sensor fusion]] is collecting and integrating data from multiple sensors in order to get a better understanding of the process that we're monitoring than if it came from a single source.
>	
>	[[Odometry]] is transforming data coming from sensors that give movement or displacement in order to estimate the [[ego's]] change in position over time.
